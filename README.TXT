9. I chose to make the house to start i started by creating the objects such as a circle for the sun, a triangle for the roof, a square for the frame of the house and another square for the window of the house.
  Then i proceded to place them as simular as i can to the image from figure 1.8
  Next i called changeColor to match the ones from the image
  Finaly the image is done
